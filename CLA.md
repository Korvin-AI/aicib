# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## AI Company-in-a-Box (AICIB)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AICIB. Before we can accept your contribution, you must agree to this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

### Why is this required?

AICIB uses dual licensing: the open source codebase is licensed under AGPL-3.0, and we also offer commercial licenses for organizations that need different terms. This CLA ensures we can continue offering both options.

### Agreement

By submitting a pull request or other contribution to this project, you agree to the following:

1. **Grant of Copyright License.** You grant to the AICIB project maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions and any derivative works.

2. **Grant of Patent License.** You grant to the AICIB project maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution(s) alone or by combination with the project.

3. **Right to Relicense.** You grant to the AICIB project maintainers the right to relicense your contributions under any license, including proprietary licenses, for the purpose of offering commercial licensing options.

4. **Original Work.** You represent that each of your contributions is your original creation and that you have the legal right to grant the above licenses.

5. **No Obligation.** You understand that the decision to include your contribution is at the sole discretion of the project maintainers.
