# AICIB Licensing

## Overview

AICIB uses a **dual licensing** model:

1. **Open Source (AGPL-3.0)** — Free for everyone
2. **Commercial License** — For organizations that need different terms

---

## Open Source License: AGPL-3.0

The source code in this repository is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE) (AGPL-3.0).

### What you CAN do (free, no permission needed)

- Use AICIB for personal or business purposes
- Self-host AICIB on your own machines
- Modify the source code to fit your needs
- Share AICIB with others
- Contribute improvements back to the project

### What the AGPL requires

- If you **modify** AICIB and distribute it or run it as a network service, you must make your modified source code available under the same AGPL-3.0 license
- If you run a **modified version** of AICIB as a hosted service that others access over a network, those users must be able to get the source code
- You must keep the copyright notices and license intact

### What this means in plain English

You can use AICIB freely for your own business. You can self-host it. You can modify it. The one thing you can't do is take the code, modify it, and offer it as your own competing hosted service without sharing your changes. This keeps the project open and fair for everyone.

## Commercial License

A commercial license is available for organizations that:

- Want to embed AICIB into a proprietary product without AGPL obligations
- Want to offer AICIB as part of a managed/hosted service
- Need terms that differ from the AGPL-3.0

## FAQ

**Can I use AICIB at my company for free?**
Yes. You can install and use AICIB internally at your company under the AGPL-3.0 at no cost.

**Can I modify AICIB for my own use?**
Yes. If you keep the modifications internal (not offered as a service to others), you have no obligation to share them.

**Can I build a product that uses AICIB?**
If your product is also open source under a compatible license, yes. If your product is proprietary, you'll need a commercial license.

**Can I host AICIB for my clients?**
If you offer AICIB (modified or not) as a hosted service, the AGPL requires you to share the source code with those users. If you'd prefer not to do that, a commercial license is available.

**What's the difference between AGPL and MIT?**
MIT lets anyone do anything with the code, including building competing products. AGPL adds one key protection: if you run the software as a service, you must share your source code. This prevents large companies from taking open source work and selling it without contributing back.
